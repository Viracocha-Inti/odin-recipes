        <h2>Peruvian Recipes</h2>
        <p>
          Peru's rich cuisine comes from the culinary fusion of the Incan
          cuisine fused with European sensibilities from France, Germany, Italy,
          Spain as well as Asia and West Africa.

        <p>
          Filipino cuisine is composed of varying cooking styles influenced by
          more than a hundred distinct ethnolinguistic groups found throughout
          the Philippine archipelago. It was also heavily influenced by
          Southeast Asian, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American
          cuisines.
