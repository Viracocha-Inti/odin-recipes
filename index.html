        <p>Peruvian gastronomy is regarded as one of the best in the world. Peru's rich cuisine comes from the culinary fusion that began many centuries ago, most likely around the 16th century. During this time, the Incan cuisine was 
            wonderfully fused with European sensibilities from France, Germany, Italy, Spain as well as with the deliciousness from Asia and West Africa. This plus the wealth of its lands and cultural diversity, give Peru an exquisite and tremendously varied gastronomy</p>
