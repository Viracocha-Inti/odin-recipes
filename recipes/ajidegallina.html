            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken and the peeled potatoes in boiling water, add some salt in the pot. The potatoes will be finished once they are easily pierced with a fork. Once the chicken is cooked take it out and put it in its own container and allow it to cool down.</li>

            <li>Begin shreeding the chicken until you reach the desired size.</li>
            <li>Remove stems and seeds from the <em>aji amarillo</em> and then add it to the blender with vegetable out and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add contents of blender to a medium saucepan, then add minced garlic and onions and sautee the contents.</li>
            <li>Once mixture has cooked and cooled down add mixture to the blender again.</li>
            <li>Add the salted crackers into the blender and add the 1 cup of evaporated milk. Then blend the contents.</li>
            <li>Add the walnuts and <em>queso fresco</em> to the blender. Then add some of the broth that was set aside from step 3 and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken onto a pan and simmer it for several minutes, once some of the chicken shreds become golden yellow add the sauce mixture from the blender.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking the shredded chicken with sauce and occasionally add some of the broth that was set aside when the sauce becomes too thick.</li>
            <li>Plate the dish with rice and some of the cut potatos, then add the chicken sauce on top of the potatoes and add some cut hard boiled eggs to your plate. Enjoy the delicious dish!!!</li>
