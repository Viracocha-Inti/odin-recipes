        <h3><em>Seco de Carne</em> is a one of the most popular recipes of Peruvian cuisine and one of the the most popular in the country.</h3> 
        <p>When one thinks about the traditional <em><strong>"comida criolla"</strong></em>, this dish is one of the first ones that come to mind. <em>Criolla</em> refers to the typical food from the coastal region of the country.
            The roots of this dish comes from the Arab influence that the Spanish brought with them during colonial times. The main ingredient in this dish is cilantro and due to that it has a very strong,
            intense and delicious flavor. It is very important to let the meat and vegetables simmer over medium-low heat, so it can absorb the flavors and get a fork tender texture.</p>
