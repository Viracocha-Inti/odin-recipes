# odin-recipes

First project of The Odin Project using what we have learnt thus far in HTML. This website will consist of the main index page which will explore Traditional cuisine from around the world. As of now, I will only work on Peruvian dishes and Filipino dishes.

Project will be revisited at a later date and will be updated using CSS.
