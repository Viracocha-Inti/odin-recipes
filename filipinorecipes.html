    <h1>Filipino Recipes</h1>
    <p>
      Filipino cuisine is composed of varying cooking styles influenced by more
      than a hundred distinct ethnolinguistic groups found throughout the
      Philippine archipelago. A majority of mainstream Filipino dishes are from
      the food traditions of various ethnolinguistic groups and tribes of the
      archipelago, including the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog,
      Bicolano, Visayan, Chavacano, and Maranao et hnolinguistic groups.

      The styles of preparation and dishes associated with them have evolved
      over many centuries from a largely indigenous (largely Austronesian) base
      shared with maritime Southeast Asia with varied influences from Japanese,
      Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American cuisines, in line with the major
      waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as
      well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate.
